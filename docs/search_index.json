"],["statistics-and-probability.html", "Chapter 2 Statistics and Probability 2.1 Designing Studies", " Chapter 2 Statistics and Probability 2.1 Designing Studies Population: A collection of individuals or objects that we will be analyzing on their properties. Sample: A representative subset of population chosen to be analyzed (a well-chosen sample contains most of the information about a particular population parameter. 2.1.0.1 Identifying variables type: Numerical vs. Categorical numerical —&gt; continuous or discrete? (based on whether or not they can take on an infinite number of values or only non-negative whole numbers, respectively) categorical —&gt; ordinal? (whether or not levels have a natural ordering) Associated (Explanatory) vs. Independent (Response) —&gt; show relationships w/ other vars? Confounding variables 2.1.0.2 Classify study type as ovbservational or experimental Observational studies: researcher collects data by observing but not directly interfering with how data arise —&gt; correlation only Retrospective study: when an observational study uses data from the past Prospective study: …. data are collected throughout the study Experiments: when researchers randomly assign subjects to treatments (can be causal) If random sampling has been employed in data collection, the results should be generalizable to the target population. If random assignment has been employed in study design, the results suggest causality. 2.1.0.3 Sampling Techniques Probability Sampling Random sampling: choosing sample randomly without any given logic —&gt; each member have equal chance of being selected in the sample. Stratified sampling: First divide population into homogenous strata (subjects within each stratum are similar but different across strata), then randomly sample from within each strata. e.g. to make sure both genders are equally represented in a study, we might divide the population into males and females and then randomly sample from within each gender group Cluster sampling: Divide population into heterogenous clusters (subjects within clusters are different but clusters are similar to each other —&gt; randomly sample a few clusters Multistage sampling add one other step : randomly sample observations from WITHIN each cluster, to cluster sampling Systematic sampling: randomly select Non-Probability Sampling Snowball Quota Judgement Convenience sample bias occurs when individuals who are easily accessible, are more likely to be included in the sample. Non-response bias happens when only a non-random proportion of the randomly sampled people respond to a survey —&gt; sample no longer representative (initial sample is random but the final valid sample is not) e.g. when we take a random sample of individuals from Stanford, but certain groups of population, such as from a lower socioeconomic status, are much less likely to respond to the survey —&gt; our sample is not representative enough of the entire Stanford community Volunteer Response bias occurs when sample consists of only people who volunteer to respond bcuz they have strong opinions on the issue (no initial random sample) 2.1.0.4 Principles of Experimental Design—Control, Randomize, Replicate, and Block—and their purposes Control any possible confounders? Randomize into treatment and control groups Replicate by using a sufficiently large sample or repeating the experiment Block any variables that might influence the response "],["ab-testing.html", "Chapter 3 A/B Testing 3.1 What is A/B testing? 3.2 What you can’t do with A/B testing? 3.3 Example: Audacity", " Chapter 3 A/B Testing Experimentation ranging from the underlying infrastructure, to design metrics and dashboards, to running and analyzing experiments to the processing culture needed to facilitate data-driven solutions 3.1 What is A/B testing? A/B testing is a general methodology used online when you wanna test out a new product or a feature. And what you’re doing is you are going to take two sets of users and you will show one set, a control set, your existing product or feature, and then another set, your experiment, the new version. Then, you will examine how did these users from two groups respond differently in order to determine which version of your feature is better. Example: It can be a novel big change or addition in product or feature like when Amazon initially decided to launch their first personalized product recommendations feature based on A/B testing results that showed a huge increase in revenue by adding this new feature. It can also be a very small or trivial feature such as when Google tested 41 different shades of blue. The key thing in A/B testing is that you have a consistent response from your control and experiment group so that you can actually determine and structure the experiment to determine whether there is a significant behavior change in your experiment group. The goal in A/B testing is to design an experiment that is gonna be robust and give you repeatable results so that you can actually make a good decision about whether or not to actually launch that product or feature. A/B Testing compared to hypothesis testing in traditional fields of study: In traditional fields of study such as clinical trials in psychology or medical research, we know a lot of information about participants such as their demographics, and we usually have a relatively small number of participants. However, when testing an online product, we might have millions of users, hundreds or thousands of clicks, etc., and we DO NOT know much about who is taking those actions on the other end. 3.2 What you can’t do with A/B testing? Case 1: New Experiences (e.g. premium service that offers additional functionality) (p.s. to access premium, user need to upgrade, create a log-in, and explore new functionality) A/B testing isn’t useful when you wanna test out new experiences. Because when you are testing a new experience, you have an existing set of users and they might feel that you have changed their experience and they preferred their old way (and this is change aversion). The other case is that they can be really like this new experience and they test out everything (this is called a novelty effect). What happens in a new experience are two issues: we are not sure about the baseline for comparison we can’t control the exact time we need in order to actually have our users adapt to the new experience. So that we can’t know the plateaued experience so that we can actually make a robust decision. Case 2: Time-dependent/related cases (e.g. Referral) For example, if we have a website that recommends apartment rentals, but people don’t look for apartments that often, what you really want is to grow your business by referrals to other people who like your service. The main issues in this case are: The scope of an experiment will be really hard to measure whether people actually come back to you from more referrals or from other reasons. We can’t estimate the time that people actually spend in making the action of referral happen. Cases 3: Missing/Complete content or services A/B testing can’t really tell us if we are missing something. For example, if we are building a song or a book reviews website, A/B testing can’t tell us if we are missing the entire other book that we should be reviewing but we aren’t reviewing at all. Other Techniques to complement A/B testing: Qualitative research: A/B testing can give you a lot of broad quantitative data, but other techniques give you very deep and qualitative data that are really complimentary to A/B testing User experience research Focus groups and surveys Human evaluations Quantitative approach: We can also analyze the logs of what users did on the website to see if a hypothesis can be developed about what’s causing changes in their behavior. And that’s something where you may want to go forward and actually design and randomize an experiment through a perspective analysis. We can use the two data sources to compliment each other. 3.3 Example: Audacity 3.3.1 Defining the hypothesis Initial Hypothesis: changing the “start now” button from orange to pink will increase how many students explore Audacity’s courses. Choosing Metrics: BAD CHOICES: Total # of courses completed —&gt; time issue (not should about the actual duration to complete course) # of clicks —&gt; percentage issue (e.g. 2/12 clicks in control group vs. 1/3 clicks in experiment group: # of clicks in experiment is \\(\\downarrow\\), but its ratio is actually \\(\\uparrow\\) GOOD CHOICES: \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{CTR (click-through-rate)} = \\frac{\\text{Number of clicks}}{\\text{Number of Page views}} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{Click-through probability)} = \\frac{\\text{Unique visitors who click}}{\\text{Unique visitors to page}} \\end{equation}\\] Updated hypothesis: Changing the “Start Now” button from orange to pink will increase the click-through-probability of the button. (--&gt; assume that this will ultimately increase business profits).
