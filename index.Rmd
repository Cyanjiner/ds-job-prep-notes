-   Topics covered:
    -   **`Supervised Learning:`** multiple linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, & decision trees)
    -   **`Unsupervised Learning:`** clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems
    -   *Some AI & ML innovation:* evaluating and tuning models, taking a data-centric approach to improving performance
-   Applied Learning Project:
    -   Build ML models using `Numpy` & `Scikit`

    -   Build & train a neural network with `Tensorflow` to perform multi-class classificaton

    -   Build & use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including `forest` and `boosted trees`

    -   Build recommender systems with `a collaborative filtering` approach and `a content-based deep learning` method
