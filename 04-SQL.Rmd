# Database Management and Data Systems (SQL)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(RSQLite)
library(DBI)
library(knitr)
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), ":memory:")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(connection = "db")
```

`Database schemas` show `data types` for each field (column) in all tables (data frame), and they also show `relationships` between tables.

`SQL (Structured Query Language)` is used to answer questions / extract information both within and across relational database tables

[SQL Style Guide by Simon Holywell](https://www.sqlstyle.guide/) *Keywords* are reserved words for **operations**.

## Common keywords and examples:

`SELECT` indicates which *fields* should be selected. `FROM` indicates where these *fields* are located. `SELECT DISTINCT` allows you to select field content. `UPDATE` updates data in a database `DELETE` deletes data from a database `CREATE DATABASE` creates a new databases `DROP DATABASE` drops an existing SQL database `ALTER DATABASE` modifies a database `CREATE TABLE` creates a new table

```{sql}
/*create a new table */
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    ...
);

/* create a copy of an existing table */
CREATE TABLE new_table_name AS
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM existing_table_name,
    WEHRE conditions;
```

`ALTER TABLE` modifies a table `DROP TABLE table_name` deletes a table `CREATE INDEX` creates an index (search key) `DROP INDEX` deletes an index `BACKUP DATABASE` is used in SQL Server to create a full back up of an existing SQL database `TO DIST = 'filepath';` Use *aliasing* to rename columns:

```{sql}
SELECT DISTINCT var_name1 AS new_var_name1, var_name2
FROM table_name;
```

*View* is a virtual table that is the result of a saved `SELECT` statement. When accessed, views automatically update in response to updates in the underlying data.

```{sql}
CREATE VIEW new_table_name AS
SELECT id, var_name1, var_name2
FROM table_name;
```

Group by | Having
-   the `HAVING` clause was added becuz `WHERE` cannot be used with aggregated functions.

```{sql}
/* List the number of customers in each country, ordered by the country with the most customers first.*/
SELECT COUNT(customerID),
country,
FROM customers
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY COUNT(customerID) DESC; 

/* List the # of customers in each country, sorted high to low (but only include countries with more than 5 customers) */
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;

/* List if the employees "Davolio" or "Fuller" have registered more than 25 orders */
SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
WHERE LastName = 'Davolio' OR LastName = 'Fuller'
GROUP BY LastName 
HAVING COUNT(Orders.OrderID) > 25;
```

Join examples

```{sql}
/* INNER JOIN selects records that have matching values in BOTH tables */
SELECT column_name
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

/* LEFT JOIN selects all records from the left table (table1) and the matching records from the right table (table2) */
SELECT column_name
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

/* RIGHT JOIN selects all records from the right table (table2) and the matching records from the left table (table1) */
SELECT column_name
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

/* FULL OUTER JOIN returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) OR right (table2) table records -- FULL OUTER JOIN == FULL JOIN */
SELECT column_name
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;

/* a self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself */
SELECT column_name
FROM table1 T1, table2 T2 -- T1, T2 are two aliases of table 1 and table 2
WHERE condition

/* SQL Self Join Example: matching customers from the same city */
SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, A.City
FROM Customers A, Customers B
WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID -- <> stands for not equal 
AND A.City = B.City
ORDER BY A.City;
```

The SQL UNION Operator

-   the `UNION` operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more `SELECT` statements

    -   Every `SELECT` statement within UNION must have the same number of columns

    -   The columns must also have similar data types

    -   The columns in every `SELECT` statement must also be in the same order
```{sql}
/* UNION : selects only distinct values by default */
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;

/* UNION ALL : allows duplicate values */
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;

/* example1: returns the German cities (duplicate values also) from both the customers and the suppliers table */
SELECT City, Country FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
UNION ALL
SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country='Germany'
ORDER BY City;
```
