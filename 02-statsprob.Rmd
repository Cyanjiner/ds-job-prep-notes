# Statistics and Probability

## Designing Studies

`Population:` A collection of individuals or objects that we will be analyzing on their properties.

`Sample:` A representative subset of population chosen to be analyzed (a well-chosen sample contains most of the information about a particular population parameter.

#### Identifying variables type:

-   Numerical vs. Categorical

    -   numerical ---\> continuous or discrete? (based on whether or not they can take on an infinite number of values or only non-negative `whole` numbers, respectively)

    -   categorical ---\> ordinal? (whether or not levels have a natural ordering)

-   Associated (Explanatory) vs. Independent (Response) ---\> show relationships w/ other vars?

-   Confounding variables

#### Classify study type as ovbservational or experimental

-   If `random sampling` has been employed in data collection, the results should be `generalizable` to the target population.

-   If `random assignment` has been employed in study design, the results suggest `causality.`

#### Sampling Techniques

-   Probability Sampling

    -   `Random sampling:` choosing sample randomly without any given logic ---\> each member have equal chance of being selected in the sample.

    -   `Stratified sampling:` First divide population into `homogenous` strata (subjects within each stratum are similar but different across strata), then `randomly` sample from `within each strata.`

    -   `Cluster sampling:` Divide population into `heterogenous` clusters (subjects within clusters are different but `clusters are similar to each other` ---\> `randomly sample a few clusters` ---\> then `randomly sample WITHIN each cluster`

    -   Systematic sampling: randomly select

-   Non-Probability Sampling

    -   Snowball

    -   Quota

    -   Judgement

    -   Convenience

#### Principles of Experimental Design & Purposes

-   Control any possible confounders?

-   Randomize into treatment and control groups

-   Replicate by using a sufficiently large sample or repeating the experiment

-   Block any variables that might influence the response
